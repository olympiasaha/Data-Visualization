# Data-Visualization

It is one of the main tools used to analyze and study relationships between different variables.

â€¢ Data visualization (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs, bar plots, histograms, qqplots, smooth densities, boxplots, pair plots, heat maps, etc.) can be used for descriptive analytics.

Data visualization is also used in machine learning for data preprocessing and analysis, feature selection, model building, model testing, and model evaluation.
